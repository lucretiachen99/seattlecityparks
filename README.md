# Seattle City Parks
## Project Description
This project highlights the public city parks in the Seattle area. 

## Project Goal
As our population grows, the government is making more room for more homes to be built, leaving less room for nature and public parks. However, leaving such land untouched is important because they provide environmental, aesthetic, economic and recreational benefits to our city. They also enhance property values, increase municipal revenue, bring in homebuyers and workers, and attract retirees. Studies show that city parks increase health and social connection as well. Therefore, it is not only beneficial to our environment but also to us as well. The goal of this project is to locate the remaining city parks in the Seattle area to give us a better idea of how much area is dedicated to parks compared to how much is built into other things such as roads, houses, malls, etc.
